##Gate City Research Connection Requirements

##Purpose

The gcrNet is intended to facilitate the high-speed movement of large datasets between researchers, compute resources, and designated external academic entities.  The purpose of this document is to provide the minimum requirements to allow consumers of this environment to properly connect compute resources and research equipment.

##Scope

The requirements in this document are applicable to the gcrNet Engineering Team and gcrNet Users.  Core connectivity and expansion is a strict standard for all members.  The minimal connection requirements of peripheral networking and research gear will serve as recommendation only.  The quality of connectivity cannot be guaranteed if these minimal requirements are not met.

#Network Infrastructure

The core network infrastructure funded by the NSF grant consists of the Cisco Nexus c3636c-r router providing a 100Gb backbone, and the Cisco Nexus c31108tc-v distributed switch providing 1/10/40/100 Gb connections over rj-45 copper.  Distributed switches have been placed in the following buildings to provide gcrNet connectivity:

1.	McNutt Data Center – Floor w
2.	JSNN – Floor x
3.	Petty Science – Floor y
4.	Sullivan Science  Floor-z 

#Approved Core Infrastructure

Network expansion to new buildings or floors will require the purchase of a Cisco Nexus c31108tc-v, the accompanying optics, and cabling.  The purchase and installation will be facilitated by the gcrNet Engineering team to insure that the appropriate specifications are met and to take advantage of system pricing agreements.

#Research Endpoint Connectivity

*Minimum 1Gb/s copper rj45 
*IPv6 capability preferred
*Third-party switches and security appliances are allowed to connect to the directly to the distributed switches only.
