# About the Project

The Gate City Research Network (gcrNet) is a [NSF CyberInfrastructure project](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1925623&HistoricalAwards=false) (Award #1925623) to create a multi-institutional Science-DMZ. For more information about the project please review the [project abstract](abstract.md)

The gcrNet is operated by UNC Greensboro and North Carolina A&T State University for the purpose of supporting data intensive research and is available to faculty and their research collaborators. If you are interested in utilizing the gcrNet for your research visit the [Getting Started](getting-started.md) resources.

## What is the gcrNet?

The gcrNet is a network built on the [Science DMZ](https://fasterdata.es.net/science-dmz/) model. The network utilizes a 10G dedicated internet link for transfer data across the internet at high speeds without interference from business and entertainment network traffic. The core of the network is located in the McNutt datacenter on the campus of UNC Greensboro with a distribution on the NC A&T campus. A list of locations where the gcrNet has been extended is available [here](access-locations.md).

Information about the management of the gcrNet is located in the [gcrNet Governance document](gcrNet_governance.md).

Users of the gcrNet should review the [gcrNet Standards](standards/standards.md).

## Project Information

The implementation of the gcrNet is a 3 year project consisting of 5 phases:
1. Design Validation
2. Implementation
3. Operation
4. Analysis
5. Expansion

The detailed project breakdown as well as the project status can be found by visiting the [project board](https://github.com/orgs/gcrnet/projects).

## Network Information

The gcrNet is a Science DMZ and therefore does not operate like a traditional campus network. By default, endpoints on the network are not directly accessible from the general internet and do not have internet access. All exceptions are made on a router ACL basis, not through a traditional network firewall. This, along with specialized network hardware, provides a significant performance increase when transfering large amounts of data.

*Simply put: the gcrNet is built for scientific insturmentation and not desktop computing.*

More information about the network is located on the [Network](network.md) page.
